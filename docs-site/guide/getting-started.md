# Getting Started

Welcome to HIVE-R! This guide will help you get up and running in minutes.

## What is HIVE-R?

**HIVE-R is an AI-powered software development team.** Instead of hiring 13 different specialists, you get 13 AI agents that work together to build your product—from initial idea to deployed code.

Think of it like having a full startup team available 24/7:
- A **Founder** who understands your vision
- A **Product Manager** who defines what to build
- A **Designer** who creates beautiful interfaces
- A **Builder** who writes production-ready code
- And 9 more specialists (UX, Security, Testing, DevOps, etc.)

## Quick Start

### 1. Try the Demo

The fastest way to experience HIVE-R is through our [Demo Mode](https://hive-r.com/demo):

```
Try these prompts:
- "Build a login page"
- "Create a REST API"
- "Design a dashboard"
```

### 2. Use HIVE-R Studio

For the full experience, visit [HIVE-R Studio](https://hive-r.com/app):

1. Create an account or try demo mode
2. Send a message describing what you want to build
3. Watch as agents collaborate in real-time
4. Get production-ready code as output

### 3. Self-Host

For full control, run HIVE-R locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/HIVE-R/hive-r.git
cd hive-r

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your OpenAI API key

# Start the server

```
